# Robust real-time video face recognition system for unconstrained environments

This repo contains the implementation of my paper entitled **Robust real-time video face recognition system for unconstrained environments**. This is an end to end robust face recognition system which can be used for real-time video face recognition. A novel frontal face detection measure is used which reduces the false positive recognitions by quite a margin. Follow the [paper](https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2625989?SSO=1) for more details.



## Libraries used
- python3
- Tensorflow GPU 1.13.1
- OpenCV 3.4.2

## Other modules
- MTCNN for face detection
- FaceNet model for Face Recognition
- YoloV3 for human detection
- DeepSORT for human tracking

A SVM classifier for face recogntion needs to be trained on your dataset. Follow [this link](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Train-a-classifier-on-own-images) to train your classifier using FaceNet. Replace the **sFaceClassifierModel** key in the config file ```software/input/config/config.yaml```


*Note: This is quite an old implementation so the libraries used might be quite old.*

All the configurations are handled in ```software/input/config/config.yaml``` configuration file.
