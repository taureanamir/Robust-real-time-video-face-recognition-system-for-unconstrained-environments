# Robust real-time video face recognition system for unconstrained environments

This repo contains the implementation of my paper entitled **Robust real-time video face recognition system for unconstrained environments**. This is an end to end robust face recognition system which can be used for real-time video face recognition. A novel frontal face detection measure is used which reduces the false positive recognitions by quite a margin.

We use a simple calculation based on the fiducial points of the two eyes and the nose to determine if a given face is frontal. The frontal face measure F is shown in the equation below. Consider the triangle LRN consisting of the left eye (L), right eye (R), and tip of the nose (N). MTCNN aligns the face so that R and L lie on the same row using a 2D affine transformation. We then calculate the point M on LR directly above N, then the frontalness of the face is the ratio

F = 0 means that the face is fully frontal, as in a mugshot, whereas F ‚â• 1 means that the face is approximately in left or right profile. Given œÑ is a threshold value, any face with F < œÑ is considered a frontal face.


Figure 1 represents the overall flow of the system.

Figure 2 shows different components used in the system. This repo contains the code for the face recognition analytic component only.

## Libraries used
- python3
- Tensorflow GPU 1.13.1
- OpenCV 3.4.2

## Other modules
- MTCNN for face detection
- FaceNet model for Face Recognition
- YoloV3 for human detection
- DeepSORT for human tracking

A SVM classifier for face recogntion needs to be trained on your dataset. Follow [this link](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Train-a-classifier-on-own-images) to train your classifier using FaceNet. Replace the **sFaceClassifierModel** key in the config file ```software/input/config/config.yaml```


*Note: This is quite an old implementation so the libraries used might be quite old.*

All the configurations are handled in ```software/input/config/config.yaml``` configuration file.
